# dev_log - `cartfix` branch

- investigating why `cargo nextest` and `cargo test -- test-threads 1` successfully run test, but `cargo test` does not.
    - Separate tests are sharing temp directories and failing (for `cargo test`)
    - `TempDir::new()` should (confirmed: does) generate unique root names for each test
    - `cargo nextest` nominally runs tests in parallel, but does not seem to have the same issues 
    
- Apparent cause: 
    ```rust
    std::env::set_current_dir(&temp_dir.path())?;
    ```
    is the culprit.  With *working directory being shared state*.
    - `cargo test` runs tests in separate **threads**, but *not* separate **processes**.
    - `cargo nextest` runs tests in separate **processes**, presumably why it's not erroring
    - NOTE: while the working_directory determined by ` std::env::set_current_dir` is a shared variable (~'global state'), it is not operating on an ENV_var (which I originally inferred)
    - Reading quite a bit by people working on or with cargo test team and nextest the cargo-test behavior is considered suboptimal in various ways.  However, at least in part for understandable backwards compatibility reasons the behavior is difficult to change.
    
    - Option_1: keep using `-- --test-threads 1`
    - Option_2: mutex guard on dir setter. (some prefer, but this seems like ugly over engineering)
    - Option_3: spawn a process within the test functions
    - Option_4: just commit to nextest and make that clear in repo

- Conclusion:
  - 'working directory' as a global within a process is an OS issue
  - on weight, for ergonomics and simplicity using 'working directory' (implicitly via the `./` path) for the main app still feels reasonably correct.
      - one acceptable alternative (that doesn't impact user ergonomics) is 'faking it' by just pulling out the the path of working directory and operating based on that.  (While this impacts the ability of workidn directory assumptions to be made to allow clean interaction ~post-initialization it's fair to assume we'd like to keep things constant for that period)
      - only using nextest or only using single-threaded default test would work, but feels like just leaving trip-ups in the repo.  And, ultimately, workding directory based code, especially with mutation, is just not thread safe, and that should be dealt with and announced (ideally in the region where the relevant code lives).   
      - writing this out: that would be a valid, slightly-positive refactor
  - multiple test work arounds, but ultimately (to my surprise) the global mutex wrapped code felt most appropriate.  While at face value it's an ugly 'over'complication, it actually is just an honest (and direct & loud) adaptation to a core (questionable) OS desigin decision.
